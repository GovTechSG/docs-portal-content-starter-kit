<!-- Guidelines for sidebar titles:
1. Keep titles concise to avoid wrapping: aim for fewer than 40 characters.
2. Use sentence case for all titles: only the first letter of the first word and proper nouns are capitalized.
3. Ensure that each link leads directly to the relevant section to facilitate easy navigation.
4. Regularly update the sidebar to reflect the most current documentation structure and content.
5. Tailor the categories and links to the specific needs and structure of your documentation.
